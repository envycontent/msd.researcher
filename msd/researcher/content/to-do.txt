Things to do arising from the researcher schema
-----------------
mainSchema
----------------

NB: permissions RDS: Read OxfordID and Write OxfordID (could be changed to manage_portal)

migration: strTitle -> honorific
           abandon isPI, card_id and imsu_id not needed
           job_title + univ_job_title -> job_titles (lines field)
researcherTemplates: strTitle
                     job_title + univ_job_title -> job_titles treated as lines       field
rdfexport: adjust strTitle to honorific
           job_title + univ_job_title -> job_titles treated as lines       field

researchbase: provide a vocabulary, prepopulated with basic honorific titles, so that other titles can be added on a site by site basis 

indexes: first_name
         last_name
         NOTE - we also need getSortableName as a FieldIndex for both the ORA researcher and the Plone researcher  
         
---------------------         
researchSchema
---------------------

migration: abandon institution, country of research, interests (not needed)
researcherTemplates: check as above
rdfexport: check as above


--------------------
biographySchema
--------------------

No changes here

---------------------
contactSchema
----------------------

NB should the contact address be a lines field or a string field

migration url -> webpage (url is just too confusing)
          abandon the additional fields for the separate lines of the contact_address and just copy over the contact_address to a string field (or a lines field - what is rendered in the computedField??)
          NB Note that many of these fields were originally PrivacyFields and if the contents were set to private it shouldn't be migrated over
          
researcherTemplates: url
                     no longer need to check for error for privacy fields
rdfexport: url
           no longer need to check for error for privacy fields

---------------------
imageSchema
----------------------

No changes here...

-----------------------
affiliationsSchema
------------------------

indexes: getUnits - keyword index
         getCollege - field index
         
researchBase - provide vocabularies for both these fields - ideally we will pull these vocabularies from external sources - however this doesn't seem possible at this stage, so we may need to make them manual (as per the current RDSLocal)

-------------------------
collaborationSchema
--------------------------

NB - how to make a drop down list for options for type of collaborator in one column of a datagrid field?

Is the edit display going to work with 6 columns?

Can we ensure that email isn't displayed at any point - only used for rdfexport

migration groupMembers + pastGroupMembers + allCollaborators -> collaborators
researcherTemplates: provide method to list the three types of collaborator separately
rdfexport: take new field into account
